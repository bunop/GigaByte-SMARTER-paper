  abstract = {Through their domestication and subsequent selection, sheep have been adapted to thrive in a diverse range of environments. To characterise the genetic consequence of both domestication and selection, we genotyped 49,034 SNP in 2,819 animals from a diverse collection of 74 sheep breeds. We find the majority of sheep populations contain high SNP diversity and have retained an effective population size much higher than most cattle or dog breeds, suggesting domestication occurred from a broad genetic base. Extensive haplotype sharing and generally low divergence time between breeds reveal frequent genetic exchange has occurred during the development of modern breeds. A scan of the genome for selection signals revealed 31 regions containing genes for coat pigmentation, skeletal morphology, body size, growth, and reproduction. We demonstrate the strongest selection signal has occurred in response to breeding for the absence of horns. The high density map of genetic variability provides an in-depth view of the genetic history for this important livestock species.},

Many existing genetic-analysis tools are not designed to handle such large data sets in a convenient manner and do not necessarily exploit the new opportunities that whole-genome data bring. To address these issues, we developed PLINK, an open-source C/C++ WGAS tool set. With PLINK, large data sets comprising hundreds of thousands of markers genotyped for thousands of individuals can be rapidly manipulated and analyzed in their entirety. As well as providing tools to make the basic analytic steps computationally efficient, PLINK also supports some novel approaches to whole-genome data that take advantage of whole-genome coverage. We introduce PLINK and describe the five main domains of function: data management, summary statistics, population stratification, association analysis, and identity-by-descent estimation. In particular, we focus on the estimation and use of identity-by-state and identity-by-descent information in the context of population-based whole-genome studies. This information can be used to detect and correct for population stratification and to identify extended chromosomal segments that are shared identical by descent between very distantly related individuals. Analysis of the patterns of segmental sharing has the potential to map disease loci that contain multiple rare variants in a population-based linkage analysis. © 2007 by The American Society of Human Genetics.

  abstract  = {Microarray-based genomic selection is a central tool to increase the genetic gain of eco-nomically significant traits in dairy cattle. Yet, the effectivity of this tool is slightly limited, as es-timates based on genotype data only partially explain the observed heritability. In the analysis of the genomes of 17 Israeli Holstein bulls, we compared genotyping accuracy between whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and microarray-based techniques. Using the standard GATK pipeline, the short-variant discovery within sequence reads mapped to the reference genome (ARS-UCD1.2) was compared to the genotypes from Illumina BovineSNP50 BeadChip and to an alternative method, which computationally mimics the hybridization procedure by mapping reads to 50 bp spanning the BeadChip source sequences. The number of mismatches between the Bead-Chip and WGS genotypes was low (0.2%). However, 17,197 (40% of the informative SNPs) had extra variation within 50 bp of the targeted SNP site, which might interfere with hybridization-based genotyping. Consequently, with respect to genotyping errors, BeadChip varied significantly and systematically from WGS genotyping, introducing null allele-like effects and Mendelian errors (<0.5%), whereas the GATK algorithm of local de novo assembly of haplotypes successfully re-solved the genotypes in the extra-variable regions. These findings suggest that the microarray design should avoid polymorphic genomic regions that are prone to extra variation and that WGS data may be used to resolve erroneous genotyping, which may partially explain missing heritability.},

  abstract = {Summary Since the beginning of the genomic era, the number of available single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays has grown considerably. In the bovine species alone, 11 SNP chips not completely covered by intellectual property are currently available, and the number is growing. Genomic/genotype data are not standardized, and this hampers its exchange and integration. In addition, software used for the analyses of these data usually requires not standard (i.e. case specific) input files which, considering the large amount of data to be handled, require at least some programming skills in their production. In this work, we describe a software toolkit for SNP array data management, imputation, genome-wide association studies, population genetics and genomic selection. However, this toolkit does not solve the critical need for standardization of the genotypic data and software input files. It only highlights the chaotic situation each researcher has to face on a daily basis and gives some helpful advice on the currently available tools in order to navigate the SNP array data complexity.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In recent years, the use of genomic information in livestock species for genetic improvement, association studies and many other fields has become routine. In order to accommodate different market requirements in terms of genotyping cost, manufacturers of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays, private companies and international consortia have developed a large number of arrays with different content and different SNP density. The number of currently available SNP arrays differs among species: ranging from one for goats to more than ten for cattle, and the number of arrays available is increasing rapidly. However, there is limited or no effort to standardize and integrate array- specific (e.g. SNP IDs, allele coding) and species-specific (i.e. past and current assemblies) SNP information.\n\nRESULTS: Here we present SNPchiMp v.3, a solution to these issues for the six major livestock species (cow, pig, horse, sheep, goat and chicken). Original data was collected directly from SNP array producers and specific international genome consortia, and stored in a MySQL database. The database was then linked to an open-access web tool and to public databases. SNPchiMp v.3 ensures fast access to the database (retrieving within/across SNP array data) and the possibility of annotating SNP array data in a user-friendly fashion.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: This platform allows easy integration and standardization, and it is aimed at both industry and research. It also enables users to easily link the information available from the array producer with data in public databases, without the need of additional bioinformatics tools or pipelines. In recognition of the open-access use of Ensembl resources, SNPchiMp v.3 was officially credited as an Ensembl E!mpowered tool. Availability at http://bioinformatics.tecnoparco.org/SNPchimp.},

  abstract = {One of the main advantages of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array technology is providing genotype calls for a specific number of SNP markers at a relatively low cost. Since its first application in animal genetics, the number of available SNP arrays for each species has been constantly increasing. However, conversely to that observed in whole genome sequence data analysis, SNP array data does not have a common set of file formats or coding conventions for allele calling. Therefore, the standardization and integration of SNP array data from multiple sources have become an obstacle, especially for users with basic or no programming skills. Here, we describe the difficulties related to handling SNP array data, focusing on file formats, SNP allele coding, and mapping. We also present SNPConvert suite, a multi-platform, open-source, and user-friendly set of tools to overcome these issues. This tool, which can be integrated with open-source and open-access tools already available, is a first step towards an integrated system to standardize and integrate any type of raw SNP array data.

We included monthly temperature (minimum, maximum and average), precipitation, solar radiation, vapour pressure and wind speed, aggregated across a target temporal range of 1970–2000, using data from between 9000 and 60 000 weather stations. Weather station data were interpolated using thin-plate splines with covariates including elevation, distance to the coast and three satellite-derived covariates: maximum and minimum land surface temperature as well as cloud cover, obtained with the MODIS satellite platform. Interpolation was done for 23 regions of varying size depending on station density. Satellite data improved prediction accuracy for temperature variables 5–15% (0.07–0.17 °C), particularly for areas with a low station density, although prediction error remained high in such regions for all climate variables. Contributions of satellite covariates were mostly negligible for the other variables, although their importance varied by region. In contrast to the common approach to use a single model formulation for the entire world, we constructed the final product by selecting the best performing model for each region and variable. Global cross-validation correlations were ≥ 0.99 for temperature and humidity, 0.86 for precipitation and 0.76 for wind speed. The fact that most of our climate surface estimates were only marginally improved by use of satellite covariates highlights the importance having a dense, high-quality network of climate station data.},

This Comment is the first formal publication of the FAIR Principles, and includes the rationale behind them, and some exemplar implementations in the community.},
